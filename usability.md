**Accessible typography - Font choice:**
Through the use of the google Poppins font, we were able to improve usability and acessability for people with cognitive disabilities since 
"Some popular fonts, such as Poppins, have proven to be readable with individuals who have cognitive disabilities."

**Color - contast:**
The three primary colours used in our website are:
- #f7595a
- black 
- white
and the secondary colours are:
- #f35586
- #f4f4f4
Since the blacks and whites are predominately used for the background and text with the watermelon red colour used as an accent
we have used good colour contrast throughout increasing our website usability and acessability.

**Hovering a clickable elements:**
Throughout our website, anything that is clickable changes colour or opacity. Any text that is clickable such as a users name,
number of likes to see everyone to while a post, number of comments to see all the comments, the like and comments buttons
and a few more all have a hover of the watermelon red colour. Meaning when hovered on the black text changes to watermelon red
and the coursor changes to the lcikable cursor to make it clear to the user that the element they are hvoering on it clickable.
Furthermore, any buttons that are evidently clickable such as "Post Job", "Edit Job" and "Edit profile" are shaped clearly like
a button and change opaacity with a change of cursor to show that they are clickable buttons to perform an action.
Overall, these changes also help with usability adn acessability as it makes it clear what elements on the page are clickable.

**Shadows on the post:**
Through implementing a hoverable shadow on the posts in the feed it is clear for the user to know what post they are currently 
hovering on and what is the current focus on the screen. This also draws attneion to the post they are currently on, increasing useability.

**Nav bar:**
Through creating a navigation bar with visual and textual prompts it is clear to the user what options are available within the 
website. Furthermore, the use of icons in combition to the text to describe which page each button leads to helps with any 
language barriers that may exist as we have used universal icons theat are comonly used in many other websites and platforms.
Additionally, th active state on the nav bar makes it very clear to the user which page they are currently on, while the hoverable throughout
it makes it very clear as to if the click at that point, which page they will end on. Overall, this increases uability and
acessibility of our website.

**Profile image - Alt text:**
Through disdplaying the rpofile image anywhere a profile name is displayed it is clear to the user which profile they are currently
viewing. Furthermore, trhough implementing alt text for all images used to convey the “why” of the image as it relates to the 
content of the webpage, while also enabling screen readers to read the information about on-page images for the benefit of a 
person with complete lack of sight, visually impaired, or who is otherwise unable to view the images on the page. Evidently, 
increasing the usability and acessability of our website.

**Indiciation of required fields:**
Through adding a resd asteriks next to the labels of required field, it is clear to the used which field of input are required.
This ultimatley increade usability of our website.

**Error modal**
Through having an error modal that displays a clear message as to where validation failed due to user input it is clear what mistake the user made and how they can fix it for next time. Furthermore, in using modals the error does not dissapear after a certain amount of time and it is up to the user when the wish to close the error message, hence, imporoving usabilitiy.
